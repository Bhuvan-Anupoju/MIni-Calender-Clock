# 📅🕝 Calendar and Clock 

#### 🔰overview
- Developed a Calendar and Clock web application where both components update dynamically in real-time.
 - The layout is split into two sections:

- Left Side – Displays a calendar that shows the current date and highlights the present day.

- Right Side – Features a digital clock that updates every second to display the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds).

- This project focuses on real-time functionality using JavaScript for dynamic updates. While the layout is currently not responsive, the static design allows for clear separation of the calendar and clock elements.
